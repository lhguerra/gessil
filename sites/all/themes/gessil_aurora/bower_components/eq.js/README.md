### Element queries, fast and light

Element queries are the "holy grail" of responsive web design, allowing you to create a single component that can be dropped into any position in any layout and have them respond appropriately. Unfortunately, due to some hard-to-deal-with chicken-and-egg cases, especially involving inline elements, it's unlikely that element queries will make it into browsers any time soon.

**eq.js** aims to be a relatively easy to use drop-in solution to JavaScript powered element queries. Weighing in at about 2.8KB minified, less than 1.2KB gzipped, and requiring no external dependencies, **eq.js** sets itself apart through size, speed, and ease of use. Simply drop **eq.js** on to your site and set the `eq-pts` attribute to your element and you're ready to go!

## Installation

Installation is super easy. You can either pull down a copy from GitHub here, or you can install from [Bower](http://bower.io):

```bash
bower install eq.js --save
```

Then, add either `eq.js` or `eq.min.js` to your HTML, and you're ready to rock!

## Usage

In order to use **eq.js**, you need to both include `eq.js` on your site and set up the `data-eq-pts` attribute on your desired element. `data-eq-pts` needs to be written in `key: value` pairs separated by a comma `,`, with the key being the human-readable name of the applied state and the value being the `min-width` pixel width of the element you would like to set the state at.

```html
<div class="component" data-eq-pts="small: 400, medium: 600, large: 900">
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
</div>
```

When **eq.js** has determined which state your element is in, it will add an `data-eq-state` attribute to the element set to the human-readable name of the `min-width` specified. If the element is smaller than the smallest state, there will be no `data-eq-state` attribute. If you did not write your states in order, fear not, they will be sorted for you.

**eq.js** also adds `window.eqjs` to allow you to utilize **eq.js** in your own function calls. It will handle your `onload` event and all `resize` events, querying your DOM to determine what nodes need to be queried each time. If you AJAX in any nodes that you would like to query, you need to trigger the query yourself. This is easy though! Just load up your nodes into an array or a NodeList and pass that to `eqjs.query(nodes)`, and **eq.js** will work its magic. `eqjs.query()` also allows for a callback function that will be fired after all updates have been applied. `eqjs.query()` also takes a callback as a second argument with optional `nodes` parameter (for the nodes that were worked on) that will be fired once all of the nodes have been processed.

From there, proceed with styling as normal! Because **eq.js** uses attributes, you're going to want to select using attribute selectors. Styling follows the same patters as normal `min-width` media query styling, with styling for the base first, then subsequent styling added on top:

#### Sass

```scss
.container {
	border: 2px solid red;
	background-color: rgba(red, .25);
	
	&[data-eq-state="small"] {
	  border-color: green;
	  background-color: rgba(green .25);
	}
	
	&[data-eq-state="medium"] {
	  border-color: orange;
	  background-color: rgba(orange, .25);
	}
	
	&[data-eq-state="large"] {
	  border-color: blue;
	  background-color: rgba(blue, .25);
	}
}
```

#### CSS

```css
.container {
  border: 2px solid red;
  background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.25);
}
.container[data-eq-state="small"] {
  border-color: green;
  background-color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 0.25);
}
.container[data-eq-state="medium"] {
  border-color: orange;
  background-color: rgba(255, 165, 0, 0.25);
}
.container[data-eq-state="large"] {
  border-color: blue;
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.25);
}
```

### Bonus!

If you're using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), **eq.js** comes with a Sass partial, `_eq.scss`, that provides an `eq` mixin for handling element queries. Import it and use it like you would use a media query mixin, like the one provided by [Breakpoint](https://github.com/team-sass/breakpoint). The above Sass example then becomes something like the following:

```scss
@import "eq";

.container {
	border: 2px solid red;
	background-color: rgba(red, .25);
	
	@include eq('small') {
	  border-color: green;
	  background-color: rgba(green .25);
	}
	
	@include eq('medium') {
	  border-color: orange;
	  background-color: rgba(orange, .25);
	}
	
	@include eq('large') {
	  border-color: blue;
	  background-color: rgba(blue, .25);
	}
}
```

If you're compiling with Compass, you're probably going to want to add your bower components directory to your import path to make importing `_eq.scss` easy. To do so, add something like the following to your `config.rb` file:

```ruby
add_import_path "bower_components/eq.js/sass"
```

## Browser Support

**eq.js** uses [`document.querySelectorAll()`](http://caniuse.com/queryselector) and provides polyfills for [`requestAnimationFrame()`](http://caniuse.com/requestanimationframe) and [`Object.getPrototypeOf`](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15851520/703084). It has been tested in the following browsers:

* IE9+ (IE8+ with [domready](https://github.com/ded/domready) available for `DOMContentLoaded` support)
* Firefox 3.5+
* Chrome
* Safari
* Opera 10.0+
* iOS Safari
* Opera Mini
* Android Browser
* Blackberry Browser
* Opera Mobile
* Chrome for Android
* Firefox for Android
* IE Mobile

**Caveats**: On the current test site in IE8, the correct attributes get applied and the correct CSS gets applied (check in the developer tools, be sure to refresh the HTML after you've loaded the page or it'll appear as if they haven't!), but the correct paint doesn't get applied. I'm not entirely sure this is why, I guess this is due to the number of nodes, but really I've got no idea why it doesn't repaint properly.

## Todo

* Provide Sass mixins and CSS API to reduce what needs to be controlled in HTML (maybe)

## Technical Mumbo Jumbo

**eq.js** has been tested in all modern browsers with thousands of nodes all requesting element queries. The limiting factor performance wise is JavaScript's native `offsetWidth` calculation, which is required for each element; hey, it's an element query after all! We work on reducing read/write layout thrashing by grouping reads separately from writes.

The process for determining which state to apply is primarily greedy for no state, then greedy for the largest state. If the element is neither smaller than its smallest state nor larger than its largest state, it then traverses each state to determine which state is correct. It does this by comparing one state to the next state up, ensuring that the current state is both greater than or equal to the defined `min-width` value and less than the next state's `min-width`.

Performance wise, the script handles itself very well even with thousands of nodes. With this current test setup of around 2.2k nodes, it can parse all of the nodes, calculate the size, and apply the proper attributes in about 35ms. We're employing [requestAnimationFrame](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/animations/) to reduce layout thrashing and produce smooth layout and resize. **eq.js** also comes with the full [requestAnimationFrame Polyfill](http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/) by Erik MÃ¶ller and Paul Irish.

Be careful what changes you choose to make with this new found power. While element queries are great in theory, they can cause lots of heartache, especially when combined with inline elements. This script very consciously does not and will not attempt to recalculate element queries on all DOM changes as that is very likely to result in a never-ending rabbit hole of craziness. This, IMO, is one of the biggest things holding back element queries being implemented natively.

### tl;dr

`offsetWidth` is slow, `requestAnimationFrame` reduces layout thrashing, **eq.js** is greedy for natural then largest states, with great power comes great responsibility.
